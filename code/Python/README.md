# CCR Data Download and Report (Python notebook version)

** Created by Marielle Pinheiro on 2019-07-01.**

### This repo contains:

* CCR_data_import_format.ipynb: downloads observations, chemical storet data, and SDWIS data
* Imports the zip files, joins all into a common table. Outputs a CSV file (~4.25 GB)
* Does not have the full capabilities of the R code yet, but it's a work in progress!

### Future directions:

* Figure out what kind of visualizations would be useful for public consumption
